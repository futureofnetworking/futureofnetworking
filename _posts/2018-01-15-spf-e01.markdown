Welcome to the first episode of *Shortest Path First* (SPF) as short duration podcast (they will be less than 10 minutes) about recent events in modern networking.

E01 goes over what *The Future of Networking* is up to, and is based on our [introduction post](https://futureofnetworking.github.io/fn/2018/01/03/intro.html). We are just getting started here at fn.
